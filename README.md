## :wave: Description: 
<p> 
Git-It-Done is an application that allows users to search for other accounts on GitHub. When searched you can view an array of public repositories associated with that account. When clicking a specific repository users are brought to a second HTML page and any active Issue and Pull Request will be displayed in a list. Additionally users can use this application to search for active repositories based on a programming language. Finally, when users click on any Issue or Pull Request they will be redirected to it's active GitHub post.

Git-It-Done was brought to life through JavaScript and GitHub's API, this application was the first time I utilized third-party API's within a project and was a part of my course at the UCLA Coding Bootcamp. However feeling the need to go further and proudly call this app my own, I have extended and improved upon this app by adding new features and visual changes that weren't apart of the base project.

To further note, the base bootcamp project ended at commit 39168de68f29a98bc757df8d5fcd1d2d95a9fb29, anything after are ammendments that I personally made. My specific changes targeted the 'Search By Topic', users must now use a form select to pick from a variety of languages, allowing for a smoother user experience. Additionally my changes were focused on the UI of the app and it's reliability on mobile devices. Big thanks to the UCLA Coding Bootcamp for their direction, thank YOU for checking Git-It-Done out - I hope you enjoy it and happy coding!
